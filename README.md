# Emoji Browser

Emoji Browser is a React-based web application that allows users to browse and filter through a collection of emojis. Users can explore different categories, view emoji details, and navigate through pagination.

## Features

- **Emoji Listing**: Display emojis in a card layout, including their HTML code, name, category, and group.

- **Filter by Category**: Use the category dropdown to filter emojis based on different categories. The "all" option displays all available emojis.

- **Pagination**: Navigate through the paginated emoji list using the pagination buttons. Each page shows a specified number of emojis per page.

  ## API

The Emoji Browser application fetches the emoji data from the EmojiHub API, which provides a collection of emojis. The API endpoint used is:

- API URL: `https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/all`

Please note that the EmojiHub API is a third-party API, and its availability and data may be subject to change.
